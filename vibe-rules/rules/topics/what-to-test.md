### slipbox: What to Test

✅ DO test:

- User sees correct content after action
- Navigation works after delete/save
- Auto-save actually persists data
- Form submissions update the UI

❌ DON'T test:

- SSE event format or structure
- Datastar signal internals
- The exact mechanism of updates
- Implementation details
